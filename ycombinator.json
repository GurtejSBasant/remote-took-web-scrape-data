Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in the event of success.”\r\n\r\n- Why tho?\r\n    \r\n    Risk + Excitement + Hard Work == Startup. Sure, you could join a big company and make decent money but it's that constant thrill of hope, the addictive energy that makes Robert and I come back to startups over and over again 😵‍💫\r\n    \r\n    To thrive here, you’ve got to embrace this delulu universe, where the victories give us hope and the failures make us want it even more. Yes, we work late hours and often deal with some bullshit, but you'll be part of something bigger and even more you will have a direct impact on EVERYTHING.\r\n    \r\n    If you're ready to roll up your sleeves, identify your own features to build, and find your own problems to solve, then come on in. Grab a beer and a slice of pizza, and dive into creating the future of natural language programming and AI agents. Together, we'll revolutionize the way we work. Green Light. 🟢\r\n    \r\n\r\n## So what is Wordware?\r\n\r\n*[**Wordware](https://wordware.ai/)** is a prompt-first programming language that can be used by non-developers ([AI Engineers](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer)). We merge concepts like loops, logic and functions from the world of classical programming with the non-deterministic nature of Language Models. It’s exposed in a web-hosted IDE with features like sharing, forking and API deployment.*\r\n\r\n*[Sign up](https://app.wordware.ai/)* — try the onboarding flow\r\n\r\nTry some prompts:\r\n\r\n1. ReAct Agent — https://app.wordware.ai/r/8e8b46b3-8643-4eac-9bc3-b9907ae67f36\r\n2. Make a personal website research agent — https://app.wordware.ai/r/e3d4e2d6-07c5-49d7-8522-0d53cd7021d2\r\n\r\n\r\n## Traction and Team\r\n    \r\n- **Traction:** We recently closed a paid partnership with 7000 employees enterprise for 80k (3 months), moving to 1MM ARR if successful + 1 smaller enterprise client. We also have paying SMB clients ($99-500 per seat per month) and 3000MAUs in the community.\r\n- **Team:** *We’re product-first builders with a track record of shipping ML for the last ten years.*\r\n- *We’ve worked with LLMs since BERT and GPT-2 and created well-performing stacks before MLOps was a term.*\r\n- *We both have had exits in the field, with Robert being one of the first engineers at FiveAI (acquired by Bosch for 1xx MM) and Filip’s companies raising collectively 10MM.*\r\n- *We met 10 years ago at Cambridge University and worked as full-time co-founders for the last 2.5 years through highs and lows (last project made 360k ARR)*\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Come work with us\r\n\r\n**If a position you would find interesting is not above don't worry.** If you love what we are doing reach out to me anyway ( founders [at] [wordware.ai](http://wordware.ai) ). Ideally, mention how would you improve our company and try to do it before the application even starts. Or build something using [app.wordware.ai](http://app.wordware.ai). Just be proactive! We are busy! **If you think you are fucking excellent just drop me your LinkedIn.**\r\n\r\nWe will reach a decision within 14 days and normally pay you for your work if we go through some trial during that time.\r\n\r\nAlso, join our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/6Zm5FGC2kR) and share something you built with Wordware!",

We have a ton of cool ways to make that work, and a bunch of brands already using our platform.\r\n\r\nEmail: hello@onetext.com\r\n\r\nOur stack:\r\n\r\nFront-end: JS/TS/React\r\n\r\nAPI: Node/TS/Postgres/Redis\r\n\r\nServices: Shopify/Twilio/PayPal/Stripe/Authorize.net\r\n\r\nWhat we do: payments, vaulting, automated conversations, and merchant-facing dashboards. Plus a whole load of interesting things in-between.\r\n\r\nMost important skill: be able to communicate well, and learn quickly. Doesn't matter if you haven't used every technology listed above, so long as you're a fast learner and happy to jump quickly into new things.\r\n\r\nExperience level: any. So long as you can code, if we like you and you're a good fit, we'll find a role for you.\r\n\r\nExpectations: it's a startup, and we just got accepted into YCombinator 2023. So it will be busy, there's no avoiding that. But we want to create a great engineering culture that fosters innovation, learning, and mentorship. We want to teach, and we want to learn from you too.\r\n\r\nLocation: we're both CA (bay area), open to remote anywhere in US, may be able to make non-US work with some kind of contracting role but priority given to US-based folk.\r\n\r\nSalary: completely dependent on experience and skill. Equity on the table. (Apologies for being vague here. Our plan is to create the role and compensation around the candidate we think is the best fit)\r\n\r\nhttps://bluepnume.medium.com/you-dont-know-jack-about-sms-ce68304c3d5c\r\n\r\nhttps://bluepnume.medium.com/subscriptions-are-out-refills-are-in-311fd6e41e5e\r\n\r\nhttps://bluepnume.medium.com/dtc-brands-have-a-huge-blind-spot-vaulting-13ea7ef5b2f\r\n\r\nSend us an email about yourself!",

Using this experimental dataset, we plan to create an AI model that will be able to predict high-yielding reaction condition for organic reactions without any wet-lab experimentation.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for an experienced organic chemist who would:\r\n\r\n* Plan the reactions - substrate scope and reaction conditions\r\n* Design controls\r\n* Work with the robots to execute the experiments\r\n* Analyze the reactions on HPLC-MS\r\n* Help with running the lab overall\r\n\r\n**About us & What we offer**\r\n\r\nWe are an early stage startup - currently a team of 3 friends in their 20s with backgrounds in Chemistry and Computer Science - and we hope to build datasets and models that will revolutionize how organic synthesis is done.\r\n\r\nApart from a fast-paced startup environment, we offer an interesting job on the intersection of Chemistry and Data-Science in a well-funded lab. As we are a small team without strongly defined structure, you will be able to work on what you’re the best at without any unnecessary internal meetings or reports, helping to define the direction and success of the company.\r\n\r\n### **Skills & Qualifications**\r\n\r\nAs a candidate, you should:\r\n\r\n* Have extensive experience with working in an organic chemistry lab\r\n* Be able to work independently, and pro-actively solve any (unexpected) experimental problems\r\n\r\nIt is beneficial, although not at all necessary, to:\r\n\r\n* Have experience with synthetic reactions commonly used in medicinal chemistry, namely metal-catalyzed cross-couplings such as Suzuki or Buchwald-Hartwig\r\n* Know how to use and maintain HPLC-MS\r\n* Know Python",

You’re the perfect candidate if you feel comfortable writing web services, diving into linkers, coding microcontrollers, exploring AI, and staring at the W3 specifications for hours on end.\r\n\r\nOur current team is made up of similarly cracked engineers: our side projects include AI Metaframeworks, plasma physics simulations, from-scratch RC airplanes, and homebuilt web browsers(!!).\r\n\r\nOur office is literally my old apartment - it’s cozy, sunny, in a safe area, and you get to sit next to me while we bang out the next year of features. You’d be the first fulltime in-person employee, so the experience will be much closer to a founding engineer than a corporate drone.\r\n\r\nOur current projects include binary patching Rust, a linker-based asset system, a deploy platform, server-side HTML streaming, local-first AI finetuning, a TUI devtool, and rendering Firefox’s CSS engine with WGPU.\r\n\r\nIdeally you have a good sense of API design and an eye for polish. Our CLI is literally called `dx` - developers are at the core of our design! Our docs are generated by proc macros!\r\n\r\nThis is an in-person role - you’re free to work on a beach for a week (team offsite?!) but the typical week will involve a healthy dose of startup grind. Please, keep your weekends full of fun.\r\n\r\nRead more about us:\r\n\r\n[http://github.com/dioxuslabs/](http://github.com/dioxusLabs/)\r\n\r\n[http://github.com/dioxuslabs/dioxus](http://github.com/dioxusLabs/dioxus)\r\n\r\n<http://dioxuslabs.com>",

This, we believe, is the best way to learn about our software systems, best practices and standards in the industry. You are also expected to contribute back by asking questions and by helping the team arrive at decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour work will primarily involve converting the proposed design, interfaces and architectures into Services and Applications. Much of this implementation will be on top of databases: creating data access layers and implementing Application programming interfaces (APIs).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be the owner of the product you will be working on, right from the implementation, testing, product demo, and production deployment, to the monitoring of the application.",
